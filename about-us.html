<h1>About Tight Clinic: Women's Health Physiotherapy and Pelvic Care</h1>
<section id="mission">
<h2>Our Mission, Values, and Scope of Care</h2>
<p>Tight Clinic is dedicated to providing education, resources, and support for individuals experiencing a tight or hypertonic pelvic floor. Our mission is to empower people across Canada with knowledge about pelvic floor physiotherapy, vaginal pain treatment, vaginismus treatment, and pelvic floor rehabilitation. We believe that everyone deserves access to compassionate, evidence-informed, and trauma-sensitive care that respects their autonomy, dignity, and unique needs.</p>
<p>Pelvic floor dysfunction affects many individuals, yet it is often misunderstood or overlooked. A tight pelvic floor—where muscles are overly tense and unable to relax—can cause significant pain, discomfort, and disruption to daily life. Symptoms such as pelvic pain, painful intercourse, difficulty with bowel movements, and urinary urgency are common, yet many people suffer in silence, unsure where to turn for help. Tight Clinic exists to break that silence and provide clear, supportive information about pelvic health.</p>
<p>Our approach is rooted in education and empowerment. We recognize that seeking care for pelvic floor concerns can feel vulnerable and intimidating. That is why we emphasize consent, privacy, and patient choice at every step. Whether you are searching for a pelvic health clinic near me in Canada, trying to understand your symptoms, or preparing for your first pelvic floor physiotherapy appointment, we are here to guide you with accurate, accessible, and compassionate information.</p>
<p>We are committed to inclusive care. Pelvic floor dysfunction can affect people of all genders, ages, and backgrounds. While much of the language around pelvic health focuses on women's pelvic health, we recognize that transgender, non-binary, and gender-diverse individuals also experience pelvic floor concerns and deserve affirming, knowledgeable care. Our resources are designed to be welcoming and relevant to all who seek support.</p>
<p>Tight Clinic is not a physical clinic but an educational platform. We provide information to help you understand pelvic floor rehabilitation in Canada, connect with qualified pelvic floor physiotherapists, and navigate the healthcare system. We encourage you to seek care from licensed, trained professionals who specialize in pelvic health and who share our values of respect, evidence-based practice, and patient-centered care.</p>

<section id="what-to-expect">
<h2>What to Expect at a Pelvic Floor Physiotherapy Appointment</h2>
<p>If you are considering pelvic floor physiotherapy for a tight pelvic floor, it is helpful to know what to expect. Your first appointment will typically be longer than follow-up sessions, often lasting 60 to 90 minutes. The session begins with a detailed intake, where your physiotherapist will ask about your symptoms, medical history, lifestyle, and goals. This conversation is an opportunity for you to share your story and for your physiotherapist to understand your unique presentation.</p>
<h3>Goal Setting and Collaborative Planning</h3>
<p>After the intake, you and your physiotherapist will work together to set goals. These goals should be meaningful to you and may include reducing pain, improving sexual function, managing bowel or bladder symptoms, or increasing your understanding of your pelvic floor. Goal setting is collaborative, and your physiotherapist will adjust the treatment plan based on your priorities and comfort level.</p>
<h3>Assessment Options: External and Internal Examination</h3>
<p>Assessment of the pelvic floor may include external observation of posture, breathing, and movement, as well as an optional internal pelvic floor muscle examination. An internal exam allows the physiotherapist to assess muscle tone, strength, coordination, and the presence of trigger points or areas of tension. However, an internal exam is always optional and is performed only with your full informed consent. You have the right to decline, pause, or stop the exam at any time, and your physiotherapist will respect your decision without judgment.</p>
<p>If you choose to proceed with an internal exam, your physiotherapist will explain each step, use appropriate draping for privacy, and communicate throughout the process. The exam is typically performed with a gloved finger and may involve gentle palpation of the pelvic floor muscles. While some discomfort may occur, especially if muscles are tight or tender, the exam should not be painful. You are encouraged to provide feedback, and your physiotherapist will adjust their approach based on your comfort.</p>
<h3>Treatment Pacing and Pelvic Floor Dysfunction Therapy</h3>
<p>Pelvic floor dysfunction therapy is paced according to your needs and tolerance. Treatment may include manual therapy (internal or external), breathing exercises, stretching, relaxation techniques, and education. Your physiotherapist will provide a home program with exercises and strategies to practice between sessions. Progress is monitored regularly, and the treatment plan is adjusted as needed. Most individuals attend weekly or biweekly sessions for several weeks to months, depending on the complexity and chronicity of their symptoms.</p>
<h3>The Role of the Pelvic Floor Physiotherapist and Collaboration with Primary Care</h3>
<p>Your pelvic floor physiotherapist is a key member of your healthcare team. They work within their scope of practice and collaborate with your family physician, gynecologist, urologist, psychologist, or other providers as needed. If your physiotherapist identifies symptoms that require medical evaluation—such as signs of infection, neurological changes, or other red flags—they will refer you to the appropriate provider. Pelvic floor physiotherapy is most effective when integrated into a comprehensive, multidisciplinary care plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You are in control of your care. You have the right to ask questions, request modifications, decline any part of the assessment or treatment, and stop at any time. Your physiotherapist is there to support you, not to pressure you. Your voice matters, and your comfort is the priority."</p>
